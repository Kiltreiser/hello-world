# hello-world
Just learning how this all works while I work my way through some Python tutorials.
I'm fairly new to programming. Did some BASIC in school a zillion years ago.
Also worked for a while in web design and then internet marketing so HTML and a little Javascript happened.
Then started teaching English in Taiwan but now getting bored so decided to try coding...
